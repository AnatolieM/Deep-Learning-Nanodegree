# Deep Learning Nanodegree

## Projects

**Project 1: [Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/Wilann/Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns)**

Built a simple neural network from scratch to predict daily bike rental ridership. Pre-processed data and tuned hyperparameters to achieve a training loss of 0.086 and a validation loss of 0.167.

**Project 2: [Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/Wilann/Dog-Breed-Classifier)**

Built a pipeline involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that can be used to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of its breed. If supplied with an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
